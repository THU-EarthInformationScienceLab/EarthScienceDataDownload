# GIS_RS_Data_Scripts
Some powershell/shell/python scripts I use to download or simply  process GIS/RS data

---
### 1. download_from_gscloud
  - Download mosaicked MODIS product published on gscloud (地理空间数据云)
  - Need browser cookie to download, e.g. copy it from Chrome DevTools to the script
  - there are always some false download result when you download from gscloud, and i dont know why.... users have to pick them out and re-download
